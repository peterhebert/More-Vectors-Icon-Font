More Vectors Icon Font
======================

An vector icon font inspired by the [Just Vector](http://alexpeattie.com/projects/justvector_icons/) set.

##Changelog

2013-11-26:
* Updated the glyphs to use the Unicode Protected Use Area instead of latin characters.
* Updated icons to latest available versions, dropped icons for decommissioned services, and added a few new ones.

Please see the demo.html file for an example of the web font in usage.

Thanks to [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/app/) for their app, which simplifies the font generation process.
